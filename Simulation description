SUMO is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous road traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks. SUMO can be run via the command line, or via a gui. 

There is a naming convention for the extension of files that are used in SUMO depending on their function , given by this link: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Other/File_Extensions.html 	

SUMO requires a configuration file to give information regarding the simulation. In this configuration file, different files are given as input to SUMO. A net-file (extension "-.net.xml") describing the network topology, also route-files (extension "-.rou.xml") describing the traffic patterns of objects, and additional-files (extension "-.add.xml") describing any add-ons for the simulation. the configuration file can also be edited to produce an output, a report, or commands via the SUMO_gui. More information regarding these files and their contents found in chapter 3 of: https://cst.fee.unicamp.br/sites/default/files/sumo/sumo-roadmap.pdf

TraCI, or Traffic Control Interface, can be used to obtain the information from the simulation loaded on SUMO. TraCI can also be used to alter the behaviour of the simulation. TraCI employs a TCP based cient/server architecture, where SUMO acts as the server, and TraCI acts as a client process.
