<!-- Parameters specify particular properties, if not mentioned, then they use default values. Sigma value states randomicity of speeds of vehicles up to 1x speed limit so not all cars travel at same speed. 

For emergency vehicles, different gui shape to denote emergency cars, speedfactor of 2 to show vehicle can exceed speed limit on road, and minGapLat is low so that these vehicles can make riskier turns and overtakes
